+ When a user first visits the site, they will be presented with an eye catching full width jumbotron with a combination of an image and text. The text clearly and simply explains what the web application is and allows them to register for an account from the off with the use of a button that takes them to the registration page. The image works really well with the text, letting the user see how they might best use the web application.

**I want the website to be responsive so it can be used on any device**
