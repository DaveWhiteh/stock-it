The user can create an unlimited amount of locations, for example, kitchen, garage, racking 1, racking 2, etc. Then in these locations you can create stock lists which will help the user keep on top of how many items they have, noting the name, description, quantity, date of purchase and expiry date.

The site will be targeted towards individuals who require a basic yet effective way to manage inventory, whether that be from a personal perspective or a small business user.

### **Strategy**

**Site Goals**

This project is based around creating a fully functional website that allows users to manipulate data records, utilising HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Flask and mongoDB.

The main goal of the website is to allow users to create stock lists, that only they can see once they register for an account. They will need to be able to create, read, update and delete (CRUD functionality) both locations and stock lists. The website will need to be of a professional outlay with an attractive design that is both modern and simple to navigate. The site will need to be fully responsive allowing for the site to look great on all devices.
